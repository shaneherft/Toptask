# Electron Trello

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `index.html` - A web page to render.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML.
- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies 
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm start
```

run in debug mode with NODE_ENV=development, window with frame and open DevTools

```bash
npm run dev
```

run with NODE_ENV=production

```bash
npm run prod
```
